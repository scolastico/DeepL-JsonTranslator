About this project
==================
This project is intended to automatically translate json configuration files and to be able to use
them directly. In most of scolastico's projects there is a language.json file which should be
translated depending on the situation. Doing this manually (even if you are a native speaker) can
be very laborious. Because of this, this software was developed. Just a few commands and you're
done. And the great thing about it: It's free. All you need is a DeepL Free API account.
